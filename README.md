# Welcome to my GitHub! 

### Hi, I'm Jon! 

I am a **Senior Data Scientist** at **Nielsen**, a **Computational Social Scientist** at **UNC Chapel Hill**, and a **Data Educator** with **Correlation One**. I started in data science before it was even called data science and have worked in numerous domains throughout the entire spectrum, but I find that I am always learning and love this field for that very reason! 

I have worked in areas of **Natural Language Processing**, **Machine Learning**, **Inferential and Predictive Statistics**, **Classification**, **Clustering**, and **Recommendation Systems**. When I first started, about 10 years ago, I worked in **GIS**, **Remote Sensing**, and **Environmental System Modeling**, but I dont do much of that work these days. I still feel that there are always new ideas to explore and new tools to add to the metaphorical toolbox!

I have taught on the entire data pipeline and have guided/consulted on 100s of data science projects ranging in size from small (<150 KB) to huge (>1TB). Currently, I work with Correlation One teaching data science, data analytics, and data engineering, in some of the highest rated data education programs in the industry and work with top teir fellows who ultimately gain data positions at places like **LinkedIn**, **Meta**, **Google**, **Apple**, **Microsoft**, **IBM**, and **Spotify**. 

I love this field and love to connect with those in it! Please feel free to check out my website at **www.JonathanSchlosser.com** or to connect with me on [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanphilipschlosser/). 

Thanks and hope to talk soon!
